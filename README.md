# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification Project  

This project implements a machine learning solution for classifying Iris flowers into their respective species using both K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree algorithms. The project includes model training, evaluation, and an interactive Streamlit web application for real-time predictions.  


## 📊 Dataset  

The project uses the famous Iris dataset from scikit-learn, which includes:  
- 150 samples  
- 3 different species of Iris (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)  
- 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width  
- All features are measured in centimeters

### Prerequisites  

- Python 3.7 or higher  
- pip package manager  

### Installation  

1. Clone this repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION.git
cd IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION
```  

2. Install required packages:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

### Usage  

1. Train the models:  
```bash
python model.py
```
This will:  
- Load and preprocess the Iris dataset  
- Train both KNN and Decision Tree models  
- Generate evaluation metrics and confusion matrices  
- Save the trained models and scaler  

2. Run the Streamlit app:  
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
This will launch a web interface where you can:  
- Input flower measurements  
- Get predictions from both models  
- View probability distributions for predictions  

## 📈 Model Performance  

The project includes two different models:  
1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
   - Uses 5 neighbors  
   - Features are scaled using StandardScaler  
   
2. **Decision Tree**  
   - Uses default parameters  
   - Provides feature importance information  

Both models are evaluated using:  
- Accuracy score  
- Confusion matrix  
- Classification report (precision, recall, f1-score)  

## 🌟 Features  

- Interactive web interface  
- Real-time predictions  
- Probability distributions for predictions  
- Comparison between two different models  
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling  
- Comprehensive model evaluation  

## 📱 Web Application  

The Streamlit app provides:  
- Input fields for all four flower measurements  
- Side-by-side model predictions  
- Probability distributions for each species  
- User-friendly interface  
- Instant predictions
